<h1> RSS-Feed-Reader </h1>
RSS stands for <b>Really Simple Syndication</b>. It is a way to easily distribute a list of headlines, update notices, and sometimes content to a wide number of people. 
It is used by computer programs that organize those headlines and notices for easy reading.

Most people are interested in many websites whose content changes on an unpredictable schedule. 
Examples of such websites are news sites, community and religious organization information pages, 
product information pages, medical websites, and weblogs.
